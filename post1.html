  <h2 align=center> Lab 1 - Web Development Frameworks </h2>
  <p>One of the SSG templates would be 11ty, Jekyll, and Pelican. 
    The pros for 11ty would be flexibility in choosing templates, great use of data files/sources, 
    flexibility allowing progressive conversion of templates, content decoupled as much as possible from Eleventy, and zero boilerplate client-side JavaScript. 
    The cons for 11ty would be the less functional and cannot handle complex logic, e.g. user management, search, and dashboards. 
    This is a static site, and it is harder to add new stuff to it which is less scalable. 
    The pros for Jekyll are no regular updates necessary, great freedom for programming, no dependence on specific formats or additional formats, 
    and for the cons no graphical user interface by default, long compilation time, only a few themes and plugins available, and server-side scripting. 
    The pros Pelican uses only static files on the webserver makes it a very secure site, no database, no code is being executed on the webserver, 
    there are fast load speeds, pelican uses Jinja2 for the templating language, pelican is written in Python, 
    and uses markdown and for cons is Adding or editing content requires the computer on which pelican is installed, Using MS Word is not ideal. 
    The one that I would choose would be Jekyll. Because it is one of the most popular open-source static website generators. The template is looking very nice, and it suits me well. 
    This is a blogging-friendly template that you can use for your website. 
    The other popular SSG would be Gridsome. It is a powerful static site generator. You can use it to create pages with modern tools such as Vue.js and GraphQL. 
    The pros for Gridsome are that you get to work with Vue, it is fast, you get some nice bells and whistles, simple deploys, and a preconfigured development environment. 
    The cons are you get to work with Vue 2, not 3 yet, Image optimization is wonky, the ecosystem is getting off the ground slowly, builds could stand to be further optimized, and limited environment support. 
    The settings that we are using are JS files since we are working on JavaScript. To build and create layouts and templates for our website and assignments. 
    A setting that we can use would be CSS which is even though similar to JS, but it is another helpful tool to use as well. 
              Front matter means the section of a markdown file that gives context to the content of the file. Establishes relationships with other content and controls the published structure of your site. 
              It helps to create something that you want on your website like a text, image, or video to showcase your website or a business website.
