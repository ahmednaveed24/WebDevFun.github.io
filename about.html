  <h2 align=center> About Myself and My Journey </h2>
  <p> Hello my name is Ahmed Naveed and I am from city Oshawa. I am a student studying 
    Computer Programming & Analysis at Durham College. What I love to do in my spare time is to play sports and watch,
    love playing video-games even though I don't play that much when I used to play a lot in 
    elementary school, I also love to watch TV-series and movies and working out whether at home or at the gym.<br><br>
    
    Their are goals that I want to achieve and succeed on and that's my journet still continues with many
    new chapters to begin with.<br><br>

    <h3> Fitness Achievement and Healthy Goals </h3>
    I want to achieve having good physical body that I looking forward to. The main key is to have a good
    workout plan, a good meal plan and what days are suitable for me to go the gym. The other key thing that
    would help me to have a good healthy body is by fasting, recently doctors have discovered that fasting
    is the key for good health and good stalibilty.<br><br>

    <h3> Education & Tech Goals</h3>
    My plan for education is finishing off my Computer Programming & Analysis Three-Advanced Diploma and probabaly
    will do a transfer program to either Ontario Tech or Trent University. If I get in admission in one of the Universities
    then I will complete a bachelor degree on either Computer Science or Cybersecurity. After when I complete my education
    my aim is work for tech which is either Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, Sony or Dell. I will work their for a few years
    and then after that I will start my own tech company.

    <h3> Travelling Around The World </h3>
    My goals is to travel to different countries and exploring different cultures. I would love to travel to
    the continents of Asia, Europe, Northern Africa and Southern African and Oceania. Also experiencing their
    languages on how they talk and speak to others.
