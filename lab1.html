<h3><b>Re: Eileen Dover university application</b></br></h3>

Dear Eileen,<br/><br/>

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br/> 
of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br/><br/>

<h3>Starting dates</h3>

We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br/>
could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br/><br/>

<!-- Dates of Semesters starting -->
<ul>
<li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
<li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul></br>

Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</br></br>

You can find more information about <a href="url">important university dates</a> on our website.</br></br>

<!-- Subjects of Studies -->
<h3>Subjects of study</h3>

At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall</br>
somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</br>
the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</br> 
by are as follows, in order of priority:</br>

<ol>
<li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
<li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>

So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect </br>
the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</br>


<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,</br>
my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</br></br>

Polynesian chicken dance</br>
	<blockquote> A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</br>
	in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</br></blockquote>
Icelandic brownian shuffle</br>
	<blockquote> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which </br>
	involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly </br>
	tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired </br>
	modern styles such as Twerking. </br></blockquote>
Arctic robot dance</br>
	<blockquote>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have </br>
	discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants </br>
	of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this </br>
	because they were really cold. </br></blockquote>

Yours sincerely, </br></br>

Dr Eleanor Gaye </br></br>
